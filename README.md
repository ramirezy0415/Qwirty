# Qwirty

We've now covered the basics of HTML and CSS. Let's put it all together! In this review activity, you will be recreating a standard e-commerce site. You can visit [the live Qwirty demo](https://fsa-qwirty.netlify.app/) to see the end goal. Get as close as you can!

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository under your GitHub account using this one as a template.
2. Open the cloned repository in VS Code.
3. Build!

## Tips

While you are free to tackle this however you'd like, here are some tips:

- Break the website down into smaller components and focus on completing each component.
- Use separate css files for each component to stay organized.
- Use a combination of flex and grid to arrange the elements on the page.
- Make frequent commits as you work.
- As a last resort, you can always inspect the live demo. However, try to build as much as you can from scratch first!

## Submission

On Canvas, submit a link to your public GitHub repository.
